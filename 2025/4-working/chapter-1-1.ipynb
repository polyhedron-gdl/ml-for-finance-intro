    "\n",
    "Machine learning is an artificial intelligence (AI) technology which provides systems with the ability to automatically learn from experience without the need for explicit programming, and can help solve complex problems. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as \"training data\", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks."

However, in reinforcement learning, this feedback is not the correct ground truth label or value, but a measure of how well the action was measured by a reward function. Through its interaction with the environment, an agent can then use reinforcement learning to learn a series of actions that maximizes this reward via an exploratory trial-and-error approach or deliberative planning. A popular example of reinforcement learning is a chess engine. Here, the agent decides upon a series of moves depending on the state of the board (the\n",
