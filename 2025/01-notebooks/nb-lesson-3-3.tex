    \section{Supervised Models: Decision
Trees}\label{supervised-models-decision-trees}

    \subsection{What is a decision tree?}\label{what-is-a-decision-tree}

Decision trees can be used for regression (continuous real-valued
output, e.g.~predicting the price of a house) or classification
(categorical output, e.g.~predicting email spam vs.~no spam), but here
we will focus on classification. \textbf{A decision tree classifier is a
binary tree where predictions are made by traversing the tree from root
to leaf --- at each node, we go left if a feature is less than a
threshold, right otherwise. Finally, each leaf is associated with a
class, which is the output of the predictor}.

\subsubsection{Why Decision Trees?}\label{why-decision-trees}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Decision tress often mimic the human level thinking so its so simple
  to understand the data and make some good interpretations;
\item
  Decision trees actually make you see the logic for the data to
  interpret(not like black box algorithms like SVM,NN,etc..);
\item
  There is non requirement that the relationship between the target and
  the features be linear;
\item
  The tree automatically selects the best features to make the
  prediction;
\item
  A decision tree is less sensitive to outlying observations than a
  regression.
\end{itemize}

For example : if we are classifying bank loan application for a
customer, the decision tree may look like this Here we can see the logic
how it is making the decision.

    

    It's simple and clear. So what is the decision tree?

    \subsection{Building a Decision Tree}\label{building-a-decision-tree}

During model training on feature-target relationships, a tree is grown
from a \textbf{root} (parent) node (all data containing feature-target
relationships), which is then recursively split into child nodes (subset
of the entire data) in a binary fashion. Generally, each split is
performed on a single feature in the parent node. You will have
different kind of splitting depending on the nature of the feature:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  you can have a very simple decision tree in which the decision is a
  boolean condition (true, false) \ldots{}
\item
  \ldots{} or numeric data
\end{itemize}

In the last case we have to define a desired \textbf{threshold} value of
the feature. For instance, during each split of the parent node, we go
to left node (with the corresponding subset of data) if a feature is
less than the threshold, and right node otherwise. But how do we decide
on the split? The feature to put at the root node is the one with the
most \textbf{information gain}.

    \subsubsection{The Impurity Concept}\label{the-impurity-concept}

Decision trees use the concept of \textbf{impurity} to describe how
homogeneous or ``pure'' a node is. \textbf{A node is pure if all its
samples belong to the same class}, while \textbf{a node with many
samples from many different classes is called impure}. The difference
between the impurity of a node and that of the child nodes is called
\textbf{Information Gain}.

The goal of a decision tree is, at each layer, to try to split the data
into two (or more) groups, \textbf{so that data that fall into the same
group are most similar to each other (homogeneity), and groups are as
different as possible from each other (heterogeneity)}.

    In order to split the nodes at the most informative features, we need to
define an objective function that we want to optimize via the tree
learning algorithm. Here, our objective function is to maximize the
\textbf{IG} at each split, which we define as follows:

\begin{equation}
IG(D_p, f) = I(D_p) - \sum\limits_{j=1}^m \frac{N_j}{N_p} I(D_j)
\end{equation}

Here,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(f\) is the feature to perform the split;
\item
  \(𝐷_𝑝\) and \(𝐷_𝑗\) are the dataset of the parent and \(jth\) child
  node;
\item
  \(I\) is our impurity measure;
\item
  \(𝑁_𝑝\) is the total number of training examples at the parent node;
\item
  and \(𝑁_𝑗\) is the number of examples in the jth child node.
\end{itemize}

As we can see, the information gain is simply the difference between the
impurity of the parent node and the sum of the child node
impurities---the lower the impurities of the child nodes, the larger the
information gain. However, for simplicity and to reduce the
combinatorial search space, most libraries (including scikit-learn)
implement binary decision trees. This means that each parent node is
split into two child nodes, \(D_{left}\) and \(D_{right}\):

\begin{equation}
IG(D_p, f) = I(D_p) - \frac{N_{left}}{N_p}I(D_{left}) -
\frac{N_{right}}{N_p} I(D_{right})
\end{equation}

    \subsubsection{Measures of Information
Gain}\label{measures-of-information-gain}

The three impurity measures or splitting criteria that are commonly used
in binary decision trees are \textbf{Entropy} \((𝐼_𝐻)\), \textbf{Gini
impurity} \((𝐼_𝐺)\) and the \textbf{Classification Error} \((𝐼_𝐸)\). In
the following we will focus only on the first two.

    \paragraph{Entropy}\label{entropy}

One measure of information gain is based on \emph{entropy}.

Suppose that there are \(n\) possible outcomes and \(p_i\) is the
probability of outcome \(i\) with \(\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\, p_i=1\),
entropy can be defined as:
\[\text{Entropy}=-\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\, p_i \,\ln(p_i)\]

    Let's take a very simple example in order to clarify the concept of
omogeneity and how entropy can help us to measure it.

    

    Here our target attribute is going to classify star versus diamond.
We've got about half stars and half diamonds as a matter of fact we have
49 objects in the box and 24 of them are stars 25 of them are diamonds.
You'll also notice that we have color codes here so not all of the
diamonds are blue, there are some orange diamonds and some blue diamonds
and then there are also some orange stars and some blue stars. So our
\textbf{partition} might be on color. We're interested in predicting
star versus diamond. Our partition then we'll be on the color and so
we'll create an orange box and a blue box and then what we'll say here
is it's very very much easier to predict whether it will be a star or a
diamond in each of these two boxes compared to the original total data
set so there's a lot less omogeneity here so we would expect to have a
significant information gain when we partition on color.

    

    Let's see how \textbf{entropy can give us a measure of how well we have
splitted our sample}. Now there are 25 orange objects 21 of which are
stars and there are 24 blue objects three of which are stars. We'll
calculate the full group entropy first:

\[E(\vec d) = -\sum_i p_i \log(p_i) =  -(p_1 \log(p_1) + p_2 \log(p_2))\]

Let's plug those numbers in. So again for diamond there were 24 out of
49 diamonds and there were 25 stars

\[E=-\left(\frac{24}{49}\log\left(\frac{24}{49}\right) + \frac{25}{49} \log\left(\frac{25}{49}\right)\right) \sim 0.9997\]\\
we get an entropy for the full group of about \(0.9997\). For the orange
box then let's calculate the entropy just within that box. It's the same
process but in this case again we have diamonds and we have stars there
are four diamonds and 21 stars out of 25 objects in the orange box so we
have:

\begin{align*} 
E(\vec d, \text{orange}) &= -\sum_i p_i \log(p_i) \\ &=-(p_1 \log(p_1) + p_2 \log(p_2)) \\ &=-\left(\frac{4}{25}\log\left(\frac{4}{25}\right) + \frac{21}{25} \log\left(\frac{21}{25}\right)\right) \\ &\sim 0.6343 
\end{align*}

the entropy within the orange box is \(0.6343\) which is quite a bit
lower. There's a lot more omogeneity. The blue box works very similar.
Again it's the same formula so you've got 21 diamonds out of 24 and
you've got 3 stars out of 24 so:

\begin{align*} 
E(\vec d, \text{blue}) &= -\sum_i p_i \log(p_i) \\ &=-(p_1 \log(p_1) + p_2 \log(p_2)) \\ &=-\left(\frac{21}{24}\log\left(\frac{21}{24}\right) + \frac{3}{24} \log\left(\frac{3}{24}\right)\right) \\ &\sim 0.5436 
\end{align*}

In the blue box the entropy is actually \(0.5436\) even more omogeneity
in the blue box because we only have those 3 diamonds. The combined
entropy is going to be the weighted average so there were 25 orange
objects out of 49 so we do \(25/49\) times the entropy of the orange
group and then we do \(24/49\) times the entropy of the blue group add
those together we get the weighted average of the entropy

\begin{align*} 
E(\vec d, \vec a) &= \frac{25}{49} E(\text{orange}) + \frac{24}{49} E(\text{blue}) \\ &= \frac{25}{49} (0.6343) + \frac{24}{49} (0.5436) = 0.5899 
\end{align*}

    

    Our information gain then is the original entropy, which is about
\(0.9997\) minus the weighted average of the entropies across the
partitions by color which was \(0.5899\) so our information gained is
about \(0.4097\)

\[ I(\vec d, \vec a) = E(\vec d) - E(\vec d, \vec a) = 0.9997 - 0.5899 = 0.4097 \]

that's a substantial information gain and again just visually to remind
you what that means by partitioning on color if I then know which
colored box I'm in it's much easier for me to make an accurate
prediction of what I'm likely to draw out whereas in the original box it
was about 50/50 right twenty five stars twenty four diamonds pick one at
random I'm almost as likely to get a diamond as I am a star so
partitioning on color makes it much easier for us to do that prediction
of whether it'll be star or diamond.

    Let's do another example. Let's suppose some data for job application
and we find that the 20\% of them received an offer. Suppose further
that 50\% of job applicants have a relevant degree. If both those with a
relevant degree and those without a relevant degree had a 20\% chance of
receiving a job offer, there would be no information gain to knowing
wheter an applicant has a relevant degree. Suppose however that: - 30\%
of those with a relevant degree received a job offer - 10\% of those
without a relevant degree received a job offer

then there is clearly some information gain to knowing whether an
applicant has a relevant degree. Let's calculate the information gain
with entropy as a measure.

    When constructing the decision tree, we first search for the feature
that has the biggest information gain. This is put at the root of the
tree. For each branch emanating from the root we then search for a
feature (other than the one at the root) that has the biggest
information gain and so on \ldots{}

    \paragraph{Gini Impurity}\label{gini-impurity}

An alternative to entropy for quantifying information gain is the Gini
Impurity, which is basically a concept to quantify how homogeneous or
``pure'' a node is, with relation to the distribution of the targets in
the node. A node is considered pure (G=0) if all training samples in the
node belong to the same class, while a node with many training samples
from many different classes will have a Gini Impurity close to 1.

    \begin{equation}
G = 1 - \sum\limits_{k=1}^n p_k^2 = 1 - \sum\limits_{k=1}^n \left( \frac{m_k}{m} \right)^2 
\end{equation}

where \(p_k\) is the fraction of samples belonging to class \(k\), \(n\)
is the number of classes, \(m\) are all the training samples in the node
and \(m_k\) are the training examples in each class.

For example if a node contains five samples, with two of class 1, two of
class 2, one of class 3 and none of class 4, then

\[G = 1 - \left( \frac{2}{5} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{2}{5} \right)^2  - \left( \frac{1}{5} \right)^2  = 0.64\]

    \paragraph{Comparison}\label{comparison}

For a more visual comparison of the three different impurity criteria
that we discussed previously, let's plot the impurity indices for the
probability range \([0, 1]\) for class 1.

    \paragraph{Assuming Applicant's Income as

    The calculation of the expected reduction in entropy from Income
\textbf{requires the specification of a threshold income}. Define

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(p_1\) : probability that income is greater than the threshold
\item
  \(p_2\) : probability that, if income is greater than the threshold,
  the borrower does not default
\item
  \(p_3\) : probability that if income is less than the threshold the
  borrower does not default

The expected entropy is

\[\hat E = p_1\left[ -p_2 \, \log(p_2) - (1-p_2)\, \log(1-p_2) \right] + (1-p_1)\left[-p_3\, \log(p_3) - (1-p_3)\,\log(1-p_3)\right]\]

    \subsection{Exercise: Continuous Target
Variables}\label{exercise-continuous-target-variables}

So far we have considered the use of decision trees for classification.
We now describe how they can be used to predict the value of a
continuous variable. Suppose that the feature at the root node is \(X\)
and the threshold value for \(X\) is \(Q\). We choose \(X\) and \(Q\) to
minimize the expected mean squared error (mse) in the prediction of the
target for the training set. In other words, we minimize

\[Prob(X>Q) \times (\text{mse if } X > Q) + Prob(X\le Q) \times (\text{mse if } X \le Q) \]

The feature at the next node and its threshold are chosen similarly. The
value predicted at a tree leaf is the average of the values for the
observations corresponding to the leaf.

We will illustrate this procedure for the house price data considered in
the previous notebook (see also J. C. Hull Chapter 3). To keep the
example manageable we consider only two features: Overall Quality (scale
1 to 10) and Living Area (Square Feet).

    \subsection{Random Forest}\label{random-forest}

    The random forest method is a versatile and powerful machine learning
algorithm used primarily for classification and regression tasks. It is
an ensemble method, which means it combines the predictions of multiple
individual models (in this case decision trees) to achieve better
performance and robustness than a single model.

At its core, the random forest works by building a large number of
decision trees during training. Each tree is trained on a random subset
of the data, and at each decision point (or split) in a tree, it selects
a random subset of features to determine the best split. These two
randomization steps---sampling the data and selecting a subset of
features---help the model avoid overfitting, which is a common issue
with individual decision trees.

The training process involves the following steps: first, the algorithm
creates multiple bootstrap samples from the original dataset by sampling
with replacement. Each bootstrap sample will likely exclude some of the
original data points (called out-of-bag samples), which can be used
later to estimate model performance. For each bootstrap sample, the
algorithm grows a decision tree to its maximum depth without pruning,
but at each split, it considers only a random subset of features to find
the best split. This randomness reduces correlation between the trees
and leads to more diverse models in the ensemble.

Once the forest of decision trees is trained, the random forest makes
predictions by aggregating the outputs of the individual trees. For
classification tasks, this aggregation typically involves a majority
vote, where the class predicted most often by the trees is chosen as the
final prediction. For regression tasks, the predictions of the trees are
averaged to produce the final output.

One of the key advantages of the random forest method is its ability to
handle a large number of features, including irrelevant ones, without
significant overfitting. It also provides a measure of feature
importance, which can help identify the most relevant variables in the
dataset.

Here is an example of how to use the random forest algorithm in Python
for both classification and regression:

    In the classification example, we use the Iris dataset, which contains
information about different species of flowers, to build a model that
predicts the species of a flower based on its measurements. In the
regression example, we use the Boston housing dataset to predict housing
prices based on various features. These examples demonstrate how to
quickly implement the random forest algorithm using the
\texttt{scikit-learn} library, one of the most popular machine learning
libraries in Python.

    The reason that the random forest model works is that a large number of
relatively uncorrelated models (trees) operating as a committee will
outperform any of the individual constituent models. The low correlation
between models is the key. Just like how investments with low
correlations (like stocks and bonds) come together to form a portfolio
that is greater than the sum of its parts, uncorrelated models can
produce ensemble predictions that are more accurate than any of the
individual predictions. The reason for this wonderful effect is that the
trees protect each other from their individual errors (as long as they
don't constantly all err in the same direction). While some trees may be
wrong, many other trees will be right, so as a group the trees are able
to move in the correct direction.
